## Course Overview

Designed for students with a basic understanding of computer science, the bootcamp provided a blend of hands-on projects, interactive discussions, and practical demonstrations. By the end of the course, participants gained foundational knowledge in machine learning and LLM applications in real-world scenarios.

### Learning Objectives & Outcomes

Students achieved several key outcomes:

- Mastered the basics of machine learning using **Teachable Machine**.
- Learned Python programming and how to interact with APIs.
- Developed a content summarization bot utilizing the **Whisper API** and **GPT API**.
- Understood the fundamentals of chatbot development.
- Automated web searches and information gathering.
- Created a comprehensive Portfolio AI project combining all learned skills.
