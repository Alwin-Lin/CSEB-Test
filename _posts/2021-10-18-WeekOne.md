Today is the first week of the 4 week code lab, after breifly covereing some basic computer science, we had the honor of having Guest Speaker Denalex Orakwue talk with students regarding starting off in the field of computer science.

There were some parts regarding the lectures that needed to be tweaked but overall couldn't have asked for a better start than this.

Personally, I'm thrilled about the possibilities that these code labs could open up for all the students around the world, stay tuned for the week 2 recap.
