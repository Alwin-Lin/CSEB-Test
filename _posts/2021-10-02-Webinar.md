Before I go into details, big thanks to Joshua Jones, Diya Parekh, Paul (Yu-Po) Chang for being our speakers for yesterday's Changemaker Webinar, special thanks to Julia (Hui-Ching) Wu for getting these amazing people together, as well as GET for the Zoom tech support, and last but not least, to everyone who participated in the webinar, whether you are from Vietnam, Taiwan, or the USA, this webinar wouldn't be complete without all of you.

Yesterday we delve into topics regarding inspiring the youths across the globe to take action, touched base on what it means to become a leader, how to surround yourself with the right group of people, as well as some mental health advice when facing overwhelming challenges.

The key takeaway for me yesterday was to remember to take breaks when pursuing your dream, but keep your focus when coming back, and trust in yourself that what you are chasing after can and will flourish with enough time and dedication.

Thank you all again for coming to the webinar, I'm sure we'll have more to talk about in the future.
