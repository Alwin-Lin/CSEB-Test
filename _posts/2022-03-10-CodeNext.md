As we wrap up our recent 8-week course designed for students with no prior experience in computer science, we reflect on the incredible journey we’ve had together. With a diverse group of **16 students**—including 10 high school sophomores, 4 juniors, 1 senior, and a college senior majoring in Information Engineering—we aimed to ignite their passion for technology and programming.

## Highlights of the Course

### Engaging Guest Speakers

One of the standout features of our course was the participation of industry professionals who graciously shared their experiences and insights. Their stories not only inspired our students but also provided real-world context to the concepts they were learning. We are immensely grateful to all our guest speakers for their valuable contributions!

### Course Structure

The course was divided into two main segments, allowing students to gain hands-on experience in both Android application development and cloud computing.

#### Segment 1: Android Application Modification

- **Objective**: Students worked on modifying the TensorFlow Lite Pose Estimation Android Demo.
- **Skills Developed**: Programming, machine learning, and mobile app development.
- **Outcome**: By the end of this segment, students successfully built an AI-powered Android pose classifier app using Human Pose Classification with MoveNet and TensorFlow Lite.

#### Segment 2: Cloud-Based Android System Development

- **Objective**: Students learned to develop Android systems on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
- **Skills Developed**: Setting up virtual machines (VMs), building and modifying Android systems, and cloud development.

### Weekly Breakdown

Here’s a quick recap of what we covered each week:

- **Week 1**: Introduction to programming concepts; setup GitHub and fork projects.
- **Week 2**: Introduction to TensorFlow and machine learning; training the pose classifier model.
- **Week 3**: Implementing the pose classifier; finalizing the Android side.
- **Week 4**: Buffer week for bug fixes.
- **Week 5**: Introduction to cloud computing; setting up Colab for training.
- **Week 6**: Continued Colab training.
- **Week 7**: Buffer week / extracurricular activities.
- **Week 8**: Project week where students showcased their final projects.
